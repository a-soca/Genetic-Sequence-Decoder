# Genetic Sequence Decoder

## Aims
This Python program takes or generates a sequence of DNA, finds the complimentary sequence from the input before converting it into an mRNA sequence. The mRNA strand is then read in triplet base intervals (codons) to find the amino acids the DNA sequence would code for. Stop codons also break the DNA/mRNA strand. A graphical representation of the DNA sequence/fragments is then printed into the console for the user to analyse.

## Features
- Random genetic sequence generator
- Complimentary DNA sequence transcriber
- mRNA sequence transcriber
- mRNA to amino acid translater
- Graphical representation of DNA in console
